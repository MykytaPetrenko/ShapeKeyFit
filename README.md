# ShapeKeyWrap
Blender addon for transfering shapekeys from on mesh to another one. There is another free addon that do almost the same with another algorythm (you may check it here https://github.com/fblah/ShapeKeyTransferBlender), but sometimes it does not work properly. So have writen my own addon. It is very fast and simple (around a hundred lines of code).

# How to apply
1) Select target meshes
2) Select source mesh (it should be active)
3) Click transfer shape keys.
4) Adjust parameters if something goes wrong (most of the parameters are the parameters of surface deform modifier, the addon is based on it).
